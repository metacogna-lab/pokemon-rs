# Task: 0003 — Behavior Profiles

## Objective

Simulate human play patterns: conservative (low bet, slow cadence), aggressive (higher bet, varied timing), mixed_adaptive (vary from reward/context). All profiles fully typed and unit-tested.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] conservative, aggressive, mixed_adaptive profiles with typed params (stake range, delay params).
- [ ] Profiles influence bet amount and inter-spin delay for orchestrator/planner.
- [ ] Unit tests for each profile; coverage ≥ 80% for new code; no `any`.

## Dependencies

- Task 0002 (planner); ts-client Money type.
