# Behaviour Profiles

Behaviour profiles encapsulate how agents choose stakes and timing to simulate human-like play.

## Profiles

| Profile          | Description                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Conservative     | Low bet, slow spin rate             |
| Aggressive       | Higher bet, varied timing           |
| Mixed adaptive   | Varies based on reward signals      |

Profiles are fully typed and unit-tested. They feed into the strategic planner and orchestrator so the same pipeline can run different “personas.”

## Reward target

In the RL phase, the reward signal targets **human-likeness** (timing, stake variation) as well as payout, so profiles are central to training.

This section will expand with parameter definitions and examples as profiles are implemented.
