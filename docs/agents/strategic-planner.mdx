# Strategic Planner

The strategic planner turns **observations** (session state, metrics, results) into **action proposals** (e.g. PlaceBet, Spin, CashOut).

## Observation layer

Observations wrap raw API responses in a typed abstraction so the planner works with domain terms that match the backend (e.g. `SessionModel`, `GameplayResultModel`, `SessionMetricsModel` from the generated client).

## Action proposals

Proposals are an exhaustive union (e.g. `PlaceBet | Spin | CashOut`) with no `any`. All branches are handled explicitly so the orchestrator never receives an unsupported action type.

## Inputs

- Session and result data from the API.
- Behaviour profile (conservative, aggressive, mixed_adaptive) to drive stake and timing.

This page will expand with concrete types and examples as the planner implementation stabilises.
