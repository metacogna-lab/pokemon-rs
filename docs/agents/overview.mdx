# Agents Overview

TypeScript agents run in a Bun workspace under `agents/`. They are stateless against the database; all reads and writes go through the backend API.

## Progressive stages

| Stage | Deliverable                         | Location                    |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1     | Generated TS client from OpenAPI     | `agents/ts-client/`         |
| 2     | Observation layer over API responses | `strategic_planner/observation` |
| 3     | ActionProposal planner (exhaustive)   | `strategic_planner/planner`  |
| 4     | Behaviour profiles                   | `strategic_planner/profiles/` |
| 5     | Orchestrator (lifecycle, retries)    | `game_interaction_orchestrator/` |

## Key components

- **Strategic planner** — Maps observations to action proposals; supports conservative, aggressive, and mixed-adaptive profiles.
- **Game interaction orchestrator** — Session lifecycle, retries, and scheduling.
- **RL model runner** — Stub until Phase 4; will run policy inference.

All agent logic is typed; no `any`. See [Strategic planner](/agents/strategic-planner), [Orchestrator](/agents/orchestrator), and [Behaviour profiles](/agents/behaviour-profiles).
