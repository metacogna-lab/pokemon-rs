# Game Interaction Orchestrator

The orchestrator manages end-to-end agent workflow: session start, spins, result retrieval, and coordination with the backend.

## Responsibilities

- **Session lifecycle** — Create session, transition states, and complete or abort.
- **Scheduling** — When to act (e.g. inter-spin delays with human-like jitter).
- **Retries and circuit breaker** — Handle transient failures and wallet/rate-limit errors without unbounded retries.

## Integration

It uses the generated API client and the strategic planner for action proposals. Behaviour profiles are injected so the same orchestrator can run conservative, aggressive, or mixed-adaptive strategies.

## Error handling

`WALLET_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` and `RATE_LIMIT` must be handled explicitly; the orchestrator should back off or stop rather than retry indefinitely.

Details and code references will be added as the module is implemented.
