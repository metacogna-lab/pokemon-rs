# CLI

The Rust CLI (`cli` crate) is the main entrypoint for running the backend and API.

## Run

```bash
cargo run -p cli
cargo run -p cli -- serve   # Start API server (when wired)
```

## Subcommands

Subcommands will be documented here as they are implemented (e.g. `serve`, session create, health). See PRD_CLI in the repo for the full CLI product requirements.

## Configuration

Configuration (e.g. DB URL, port) will be documented when the server and persistence layer are wired. For now, refer to `openapi.yaml` for the API contract and the API contract doc for request/response shapes.
