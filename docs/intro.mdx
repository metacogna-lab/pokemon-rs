# Introduction

**Pokemon-RS** is an autonomous slot machine gameplay and fingerprinting system. It simulates human-like play, extracts statistical game profiles, and—once the core is stable—feeds experience data into a Gymnasium-compatible reinforcement learning loop.

## Goals

- **Autonomous gameplay** — CLI and backend drive session lifecycle and state.
- **Human-like behaviour** — Variable timing, stake variation, and session breaks via agent profiles.
- **Fingerprinting** — RNG signature and statistical profiling of game engines.
- **RL-ready** — Experience buffer and reward signals for future policy training.

## Stack

| Layer        | Technology                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Backend      | Rust (CLI + controller library)      |
| Agents       | TypeScript (Bun), OpenAPI-generated client |
| Contract     | OpenAPI 3.0 (`openapi.yaml`)        |
| Data         | PostgreSQL-compatible schema, migrations |

## Phases

Development is phased: **backend → agents → RL**. Documentation in this site will expand as each phase progresses.
