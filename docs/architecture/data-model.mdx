# Data Model

The system uses modular storage domains aligned with [DATASTORE](/database/schema).

## Core domains

- **Games** — Definitions, RNG signatures, symbol maps, statistical profiles.
- **Sessions** — Session state, history, and lifecycle.
- **Wallets** — Balances, limits, and financial constraints.
- **Gameplay events** — Spin actions and results.
- **RL store** — Experience tuples and reward signals (Phase 4).
- **Analytics** — Metrics and reporting.

## Contracts

Rust domain types are the source of truth. OpenAPI and the generated TypeScript client reflect these types. See [API contract](/backend/api-contract) and [CONTRACTS](/.agents/CONTRACTS.md) in the repo for full detail.

This page will be expanded with entity diagrams and field-level documentation as the schema matures.
