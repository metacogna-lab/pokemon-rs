# Database Schema

The schema is defined in the repo under `database/schema/` and documented in [DATASTORE](/.agents/DATASTORE.md).

## Core entities

- **Games** — `game_id`, name, RNG signature, symbol map, statistical profile.
- **Sessions** — Session state, timestamps, and linkage to games and wallets.
- **Wallets** — Balances, limits, and currency.
- **Gameplay events** — Spin actions and results for analytics and RL.
- **RL store** — Experience records (state, action, reward, next_state, done) for Phase 4.

## Indexing and performance

Indexing and temporal/event-store rules are described in DATASTORE. Migrations live in `database/migrations/`; see [Migrations](/database/migrations).

This page will be expanded with ER diagrams and per-table notes as the schema is finalised.
